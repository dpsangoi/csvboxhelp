# Getting Started

## Key Concepts

Here are a few important terms used throughout the application:

**User:** Any person who uses your application.

**File:** The spreadsheet file that the users want to upload to your application.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can upload .csv, .xlsx or .xls file formats.
{% endhint %}

**Sheet or Template:** It refers to the data modal that specifies the structure of the data you want to accept. You can add columns to the sheet and configure validation criteria via your csvbox.io dashboard.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users will be able to match the headers of their file columns with the sheet columns and clean data before uploading.
{% endhint %}

**Import:** The entire process where the user invokes the csvbox.io importer to select the file, match columns, validate data, and submit the file is called Import.

**Destination:** It is the end location where the csvbox.io importer will push the data uploaded by the user.
