# 1. Add Template

Templates (or sheets) define the format of the data that you want to accept from the users.

Go to the 'Sheets' page in your dashboard. Add a sheet and specify columns. Configure the validation rules and data format for each column.

{% hint style="info" %}
When users attempt to upload a file, the importer will validate the data for every column and inform the users if there are any errors. Users have to resolve the errors before submitting the file.
{% endhint %}

Under the 'Data Destination' tab, configure the destination where you want the data to be pushed. The destination could be an API endpoint, Amazon S3 bucket, MYSQL database, or any of the other options mentioned [here](https://help.csvbox.io/destinations).&#x20;
