# 3. Receive Data

Once the code is installed the users will be able to submit their files via the csvbox importer. The raw files uploaded by the users will be available on your dashboard's 'Import' page. The data will also be pushed to your app as per the destination type configuration of your sheet.

### Import Complete Webhook

Optionally, you can subscribe to the import complete event webhook via the sheet settings page. This webhook will fire when the csvbox completes the import process for any user. Here is some example JSON that could be sent to your webhook endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "import_id": 79418895,
    "sheet_id": 575,
    "sheet_name": "Products Import",
    "destination_type": "webhook"
    "row_count": 100,
    "row_success": 98,
    "row_fail": 2,
    "import_status": "Partial",
    "import_starttime": 87987897897,
    "import_endtime": 90890890809,
    "raw_file": "https://file-download-link",
    "custom_fields": {
      "user_id": "Z1001"
    }
  }
]
```
