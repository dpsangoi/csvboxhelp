# Import Links

Use Import Links to accept files from your users without a website or an app. Create an import page in just a few clicks and share the link with your usersâ€”no code required. It is an alternative to the import button that can be set up by adding the integration code.

After you have created a sheet go to the 'Code' tab on the Edit Sheet page. Below the integration code find the Import Link of the sheet. It will look something like this:

```javascript
https://app.csvbox.io/upload/2gzJa5YO3QPLYK6Bj7Qmq5bpbFqXno?user_id=default123
```

Simply share this link with your users to start collecting spreadsheets.

#### Referencing the user in the Import Links

You can configure the query parameters in the link to identify and match the users with their respective imports. Add up to 5 query parameters with custom user attributes that help you identify the users in your platform. The custom user attributes will be pushed to your destination along with the uploaded data.

**user\_id** is the only custom attribute that is mandatory. Apart from **user\_id,** you can add up to 4 custom attributes in the`&key=value`format. Example:

```javascript
https://app.csvbox.io/upload/2gzJa5YO3QPLYK6Bj7Qmq5bpbFqXno?user_id=1a2b3c4d5e6f&team_id=sales2&isAuthenticated=true&permissionLevel=admin&email=abc@example.com
```

#### Activating Import Links

You can activate or deactivate import links via sheet settings. Go to **Sheet Edit** page > **Options** tab > **Import Links** > Select _Activate_ or _Deactivate in the_ dropdown.

If the Import Links are deactivated the users will see the following message:
