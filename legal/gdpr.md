# GDPR

## GDPR Overview

Control over personal data is a fundamental right of every individual. With organizations across the world collecting customer data to enable them to provide services, it becomes important that companies manage data in a transparent manner with the customer's consent. GDPR, stands for "General Data Protection Regulation". It is one of the most important changes made to data privacy regulations in the last two decades. It establishes a new framework for handling and protecting the personal data of EU-based residents and is in effect since May 25, 2018. It provides the citizens of the EU greater control over their personal data and assures them that their information is protected.

## Does GDPR affect you?

Although GDPR is a data protection framework for the citizens residing in the EU, it also applies to all companies that handle the personal data of individuals from the EU. This means that almost every major corporation in the world will need to be ready when GDPR comes into effect. If you or your organization stores and processes personal data in connection to services or goods offered in the EU, then the laws applies to you as well. Also, in the event of an infringement of these laws, you can face fines and penalties from 10 million to 20 million dollars or 2% to 4% of the annual revenue of the organization depending upon whichever is higher.
