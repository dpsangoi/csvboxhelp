### Subject Matter and Nature of Processing

The subject matter of Processing Personal Data by the Processor is the provision of the services to the Controller that involves the Processing of Personal Data. Personal Data will be subject to those Processing activities as may be specified in the Agreement and an Order.&#x20;

### Types of Personal Data and Purpose of Processing

Contact information, the extent of which is determined and controlled by the Customer in its sole discretion, and other Personal Data such as navigational data (including website usage information), email data, system usage data, application integration data, and other electronic data submitted, stored, sent, or received by end-users via the CSVBox Product. Personal Data will be processed for purposes of providing the services set out and otherwise agreed to in the Agreement and any applicable Order.

### Categories of Data Subjects

The Controller’s Contacts and other end users including the Controller’s employees, contractors, collaborators, customers, prospects, suppliers, and subcontractors. Data Subjects also include individuals attempting to communicate with or transfer Personal Data to the Controller’s end users.&#x20;

### Customer Responsibility

The Controller shall be solely responsible for complying with the statutory requirements relating to data protection and privacy, in particular regarding the disclosure and transfer of Personal Data to the Processor and the Processing of Personal Data. For the avoidance of doubt, the Controller’s instructions for the Processing of Personal Data shall comply with the Data Protection Law. The Controller shall inform the Processor without undue delay and comprehensively about any errors or irregularities related to statutory provisions on the Processing of Personal Data.&#x20;

### Obligations of the Processor

The Processor shall collect, process, and use Personal Data only within the scope of the Controller’s instructions. If the Processor believes that an Instruction of the Controller infringes the Data Protection Law, it shall immediately inform the Controller without delay. If the Processor cannot process Personal Data in accordance with the instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable European Union or Member State law, the Processor will (i) promptly notify the Controller of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing to the extent permitted by the Data Protection Law; and (ii) cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Personal Data) until such time as the Controller issues new instructions with which the Processor is able to comply.

The Processor shall take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to adequately protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data. Such measures include, but are not be limited to:

1. the prevention of unauthorized persons from gaining access to Personal Data Processing systems (physical access control),
2. the prevention of Personal Data Processing systems from being used without authorization (logical access control),&#x20;
3. ensuring that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization during electronic transmission, transport or storage on storage media, and that the target entities for any transfer of Personal Data by means of data transmission facilities can be established and verified (data transfer control),
4. ensuring that Personal Data is processed solely in accordance with the Instructions (control of instructions),&#x20;
5. ensuring that Personal Data is protected against accidental destruction or loss (availability control).

### Rectification, Restriction, and Erasure of Data

The Processor will provide reasonable assistance, including by appropriate technical and organizational measures and taking into account the nature of the Processing, to enable the Controller to respond to any request from Data Subjects seeking to exercise their rights under the Data Protection Law with respect to Personal Data (including access, rectification, restriction, deletion or portability of Personal Data, as applicable), to the extent permitted by the law. If such a request is made directly to the Processor, the Processor will promptly inform the Controller and will advise Data Subjects to submit their request to the Controller. The Controller shall be solely responsible for responding to any Data Subjects’ requests. The Controller shall reimburse the Processor for the costs arising from this assistance.

### Data Breaches

The Processor will notify the Controller as soon as practicable after it becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach affecting any Personal Data. At the Controller’s request, the Processor will promptly provide the Controller with all reasonable assistance necessary to enable the Controller to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if the Controller is required to do so under the Data Protection Law.

### Sub Processors

The Processor shall be entitled to engage sub-processors to fulfill the Processor’s obligations defined in the Agreement by way of the controller agreeing to the terms of service of CSVBox. Where the Processor engages sub-processors, the Processor will engage only with sub-processors whose terms of service honor the similar obligations that apply to the Processor under this DPA.
