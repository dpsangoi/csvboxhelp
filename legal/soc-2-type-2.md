# SOC 2 Type 2

### What is SOC2?

SOC 2 is a set of standards devised by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for organizations that handle sensitive customer data. SOC stands for Service Organization Control, and SOC 2 specifically relates to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.\
‍\
A third-party auditor issues the SOC 2 report and assesses whether an organization's systems and controls meet the requisite standards. It is increasingly becoming a standard for companies dealing with sensitive customer data and is often required by customers, partners, and regulators across industries.

### **Types of SOC2**

#### Type 1 Report

An assessment of the system and controls a company has set up, at a specific point in time, with regard to security, privacy, processing integrity, and confidentiality of data. It provides an initial assurance that this company has proper controls available to protect sensitive data.

#### Type 2 Report

This focuses on the operating effectiveness of the controls over a period of time. It provides a more comprehensive assessment of a company's security controls and is often required to safely handle sensitive information.

### Features of CSVbox's SOC2 Type 2 compliance

As CSVbos builds the platform to allow the upload of spreadsheets, we must have the right tooling to handle this data. Here’s how SOC 2 Type 2 compliance will play a key role in this:

*   #### Enhanced Security

    With robust controls to protect sensitive and confidential information, we help reduce the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and unwarranted security incidents.
*   #### Increased Trust and Credibility

    The SOC 2 certification demonstrates to our customers, partners, and other stakeholders that we take security, data protection, and legal compliance seriously.&#x20;
*   #### Improved Risk Management

    As SOC 2 compliance required us to identify and assess potential risks to our systems and data, we are now better equipped to mitigate and respond to potential threats.
*   #### Continuous Improvement

    Regular audits are required to maintain the SOC2 Type 2 certification, thereby guaranteeing that we will continue to stay updated with security best practices.
*   #### Better Incident Response

    With this compliance, we have incident response plans that can help minimize the impact of security incidents.

At CSVbox, we understand the importance of data security and privacy, and we are dedicated to ensuring that our customers' information is protected. Our SOC2 Type 2 compliance means that we have established the necessary security controls and processes to protect customer data.

Achieving SOC2 Type 2 compliance is just one of the many steps we are taking to ensure the security and privacy of our customer's data. We will continue to evaluate and enhance our security controls and processes to ensure that we meet our customers' ever-evolving security and privacy needs.
