The **Custom Theme** option, allows you to personalize the appearance of the importer to match your brand seamlessly. With this feature, you can adjust colors, fonts, and layout sizes to create a consistent and professional look.

### **How It Works**

1. **Enable the Custom Theme** – Navigate to the importer sheets settings > Display Tab > select the **Custom Theme** option under **Importer Theme** label.
2. **Adjust Styling Parameters** – Use the **left sidebar controls** to modify colors, fonts, sizing and other styling options.
3. **Live Preview** – Click the **Preview** button to instantly see how your changes affect the importer’s appearance.
4. **Save & Apply** – Once satisfied with the customization, click **Save** to apply the theme.

### Download & Reuse Importer Styling (CSS)

CSVbox now makes it easy to **reuse the same importer styling across multiple sheets or projects**.

After customizing the look and feel of your importer, you can **download the styling as a CSS file** and later **upload it to another importer** to instantly apply the same design—no rework needed.

This is especially useful if you want consistent branding across multiple imports or environments.

#### How it works

#### 1. Customize your importer styling

Go to your importer’s **Customize Styling** section and adjust colors, borders, typography, and other visual settings as needed.

#### 2. Download the styling file

Once you’re happy with the design:

* Click **Download CSS**
* CSVbox will save your current styling as a reusable `.css` file

This file contains all the visual configurations you’ve applied to the importer.

#### Reusing the styling on another importer

#### 3. Upload the CSS file

To apply the same styling to another sheet or importer:

1. Open the **Customize Styling** section of the new importer
2. Click **Upload CSS**
3. Select the previously downloaded CSS file

The styling will be applied instantly to the importer preview.

#### 4. Preview and save

* Review the updated look in the preview
* Click **Save** to persist the styling

That’s it—your importer now matches the original design.

#### Notes & best practices

* Uploading a CSS file **overwrites the current styling** of the importer
* You can still make further adjustments after uploading
* Always preview before saving to ensure everything looks correct
* Keep a backup of your CSS files if you maintain multiple themes
